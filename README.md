# fg-makam
Featherweight Go implementation in Makam[[1]](#1).

This implementation is only educational and was used to learn Makam in the process.

Featherweight Go is a minimalist version of Go defined by Griesemer et al. in their paper.[[2]](#2)

Makam is a metalanguage that eases implementation of languages, aimed at allowing rapid prototyping[[3]](#3) and experimentation with new programming language research ideas.

## Idea
Implement the "Featherweight Go" calculus presented in section 3 of Griesemer et al.[[2]](#2)

The implementation was made as simple as possible. For that purpose, the code is very close to the actual mathematical calculus presented in the paper.[[2]](#2)

The differences between the code and the calculus arise only when those changes simplify the implementation details.

## Goals

 * Learn Makam
 * Show how easy it is to prototype a programming language with Makam
 * Have a better understanding of "Featherweight Go"[[2]](#2)
 * Compare this implementation to [the paper's accompanying implementation](https://github.com/rhu1/fgg)

## Future work

 * Implement FGG (Featherweight Generic Go)
 * Implement monomorphization (an ambitious goal)
 * Improve parsing
