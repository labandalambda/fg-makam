# fg-makam
Featherweight Go implementation in Makam. 

This is implementation is only educational and was used to learn Makam in the process. 
Featherweight Go is a minimalistic version of Go defined by Griesmer et al. in their paper.[[1]](#1)

## Idea
Implement the "Featherweight Go" calculus presented in section 3 of Griesmer et al.[[1]](#1)

The implementation was made as simple as possible. For that purpose, the code is very close to the actual mathematical calculus presented in the paper.[[1]](#1)

The differences between the code and the calculus arise only when those changes simplify the implementation details.

## Goals

 * Learn Makam
 * Show how easy it is to prototype a programming language with Makam
 * Have a better understanding of "Featherweight Go".[[1]](#1)
 * Compare this implementation to [the paper's accompanying implementation](https://github.com/rhu1/fgg)

## Future work

 * Implement FGG (Featherweight Generic Go)
 * Improve parsing
